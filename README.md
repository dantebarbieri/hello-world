# Hello World
"Hello World" is the first program written by programmers when they are trying to learn a new language as it involves outputting the text "Hello World" to the screen. This way, programmers learn to create a simple program that can produce output, which is the most basic program in any language.

# Languages
## Java
Java is a moderately tricky language, and if you can learn it, you will be able to move on to languages like Python or Javascript with ease. You would be better prepared to learn more complicated languages like C++ and C. Some languages are similar to Java, such as C# (C-sharp), and you will be able to pick these up in literally a few hours if you already know Java.

### Pros
- Strongly Typed
  - This means that all of the data in Java is explicitly labeled as what it stores. For instance, an integer is denoted by `int`, and a bit of text (often called a *string*) is labeled `String`.
- Object-Oriented
  - Object-Oriented Programming is about creating and using abstract models to organize better groups of related data and actions that can be performed on the data.
- Foundational for Programming and inspired many programming languages.
  - It was the first language to be able to write one program and then to run it on all machines.
  - Many other languages use the Java runtime to function; examples include Scala, Kotlin, and many more.
### Cons
- Long and verbose syntax can feel clunky
  - In programming, you often want to get your ideas down quickly, and Java is known for having to type long names of things to make the code work.
- Managed by Oracle
  - As a large tech company, Oracle is slowly dying, and their management of Java means that you may have to register an Oracle account to write main-line Java. There are alternatives where you don't need to do this, but some advanced features won't work. It'll be fine for learning, though.
- Compiled and Interpreted
  - This means that the program scans for errors and then is translated in realtime, so you need to do more steps to get a Java program running.
  - You will likely be using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to avoid manually going through the process, but this reduces the flexibility you have when choosing an editor.

### Recommended Editors
- Java-Specific Editors:
  - IntelliJ
  - NetBeans
  - Eclipse
  - JCreator
- General Editors:
  - Visual Studio Code
  - Atom
  - Sublime Text

Java is a good starting language if you are naturally logically minded and can handle its sometimes irritating syntax. The AP Computer Science exam taken by high schoolers worldwide uses and has used Java for more than a decade.

## Javascript
Despite the similar-sounding name, Javascript and Java are very different languages. Javascript powers well over 90% of the modern web and is very flexible. Web developers are in high demand, and this trend will likely continue making it a solid choice. It is a bit easier than Java somehow, but it can lead you into some bad habits that can be a little hard to break later. It will do a better job getting you used to work with multiple facets of programming as you will want to pair it with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) to build the "skeleton" of the webpage and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to shape the look and feel of the page. Javascript handles all of the web page's functionality and is genuinely a programming language, whereas HTML is a Markup Language, and CSS is a simple set of rules.

### Pros
- In extremely high demand
  - Web developers can make serious money, and the basics of Javascript are not complex. The reason that they are paid so well is that Javascript developers are expected to understand some of HTML and CSS but really to have a mind for writing efficient code as websites are often underpowered, and they have to be able to make their code interact with the rest of the web as a whole.
- Tons of resources & tutorials
  - You can learn Javascript from a billion Youtube videos and inspect the Javascript on any page you visit. You can also find a lot of Javascript tutorials online, and the documentation by Mozilla is phenomenal.
- Easy to share
  - When programming, nothing beats sharing your fabulous creations with friends, but it can be hard to do with many programming languages as your friends will have a hard time running and understanding your work. Making a webpage is nice because your friends can go to the page in their web browser, and they can see the visual results of your work.
### Cons
- The language is extremely loosely typed and resistant to crashing
  - This means that problems are often ignored, and wrong code can slip through. If you aren't vigilant about fixing things, you are likely to develop bad habits.
- There are a ton of flavors
  - Javascript comes in a ton of different variants, React, Angular, Vue, and the list goes on. It seems like there are always more and more variants being created, and your options are either to stick with a variant and become a master hoping it doesn't get discontinued, or to learn a wide variety of variants to an intermediate level to be able to help a little in a variety of situations.
- You will often be dealing with HTML and CSS, which can complicate things a little, and there will be differences depending on which browser for which you wish to write Javascript.
  - There's a running joke among web developers that writing code to support Internet Explorer 6 is a lost art for a reason. (Internet Explorer is famously bad at following Javascript standards and often code must be entirely rewritten to support it)

### Recommended Editors
- Visual Studio Code
- Atom
- Sublime Text

Overall, Javascript is a friendly language and can teach you the fundamentals, but there's a glass ceiling, and if you decide to go past it, you'll be pigeonholing yourself as a web developer, which is not a bad thing, but if you don't like it, you're stuck. I've done a fair bit of web development, and I'd recommend changing off of Javascript to Typescript (a typed language) once you get the basics. Switching can help you write better code and break bad habits that you acquired from Javascript.

## Python
Python is probably one of the most popular languages out there. It is generally favored by intro programmers and people who program but are not computer scientists. Mathematicians and scientists will use Python for its statistical tools and easy-to-use syntax. Programmers rarely use it aside from introductory learning, simplistic and quick scripts, or machine learning.

### Pros
- Famously easy to write and read syntax
  - The code will look good and should make your life understanding the logic easy. This is a bit of a double-edged sword as it can hide from you what the computer actually "does" underneath.
- Often used as a teaching language for beginners
  - There's precedent, and it seems to work well in that role. You wouldn't want to stick with it forever, but it can be good for starting out.
- Most Machine Learning is done with TensorFlow, a library written in C for use in Python
  - The reason it is written in C is that C code is extremely fast, but Python allows people who aren't able or willing to use C to practice machine learning
  - I put this because a lot of people like Machine Learning. I'm familiar with the basics, but it doesn't interest me much. I can show you where you can learn about it, but I can't teach it to you very directly.
### Cons
- Python is also weakly typed
  - Suffers from some of the problems as Javascript
- The code is particularly slow and inefficient compared with performance languages like C/C++.
- People who learn Python and do not advance to more serious languages tend to overestimate their programming skills dramatically.

### Recommended Editors
- Python-Specific Editors:
  - Pycharm
  - Spyder
- General Editors:
  - Visual Studio Code
  - Atom
  - Sublime Text

Python is an all-around good language for beginners but should be left behind as soon as you feel comfortable. You will only ever use it to handle quick scripting things if you move into the more serious languages.

# Editors
Programmers use an editor to write programs. It fills the role of Microsoft Word or Google Docs when writing a paper.

Many languages have specific editors; I've listed a few in the above sections. There are some editors which are language agnostic and will work in general. These tend to be simpler and faster editors, but they will not have many advanced features a language-specific editor might. I use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as my editor, and it is a generic editor.

If you choose to use IntelliJ, NetBeans, Pycharm, Spyder, VS Code, or Atom, I can help you get set up with these editors as I have used them all extensively.

# Possible Plans
1. Start with Python until you grasp the logic of writing a program. Then move onto Java and learn more serious programming before deciding if you want to advance to C/C++ or transition to web development in Javascript.
2. Start with Java and challenge yourself. You can switch down to Python or Javascript if it is a little too much.
3. Start with Javascript and learn the basics of programming and web development and choose between programming and web development.
   1. If you choose to program, advance directly to Java unless it proves too difficult, then focus more on Javascript or possibly try Python (I don't recommend Python if you already know some programming).
   2. If you choose web development, learn Javascript's flavors and try to get freelance web development work from friends and their associates. You can test yourself and help someone out at the same time.

There are more options and plans than just these, but this is probably what I'd recommend without knowing how logical you are and how much time you can devote to learning.

## General Plans
Ultimately, if you want to make games, you'll want to learn C++. You can do some stuff in C#, which is similar to Java, but you'll need to know Java at the very least.

If you like AI and machine learning, you can stick with Python all the way, but the mathematics is complicated, and the code is generally opaque because you won't know exactly why the computer makes the decisions it does.

If you like graphics and visualizations, then you want to go into any visual system. Java has a beginner-friendly visual system called Processing. They have ports for Python and Javascript as well. For serious graphics work, you want to use OpenGL (Open Graphics Language); though it is meant for C/C++, you can use it in any language. OpenGL is generally complicated.

If you like data and want to work as a data scientist, programming is generally not a traditional path, but it can work. You want to focus on a series of languages collectively called SQL or Structured Query Language.

I advise you to look over some programs' syntax, determine which of the three languages to start with and then write "Hello World" to test if you can run the code on your system. Once you can do that, work on things like taking input from the user, reading and writing files, and breaking problems down into manageable chunks using functions and/or objects.
